**Tempo** is an open-source and lightweight music client for Subsonic, designed and built natively for Android. It provides a seamless and intuitive music streaming experience, allowing you to access and play your Subsonic music library directly from your Android device. 

Tempo does not rely on magic algorithms to decide what you should listen to. Instead, the interface is built around your listening history, randomness, and optionally integrates with services like Last.fm to personalize your music experience.

**If you find Tempo useful, please consider starring the project on GitHub. It would mean a lot to me and help promote the app to a wider audience.**

**Use the Github version of the app for full Android Auto and Chromecast support.**

## Features
- **Subsonic Integration**: Tempo seamlessly integrates with your Subsonic server, providing you with easy access to your entire music collection on the go.
- **Sleek and Intuitive UI**: Enjoy a clean and user-friendly interface designed to enhance your music listening experience, tailored to your preferences and listening history.
- **Browse and Search**: Easily navigate through your music library using various browsing and searching options, including artists, albums, genres, playlists, decades and more.

- **Transcoding Support**: Activate transcoding of tracks on your Subsonic server, allowing you to set a transcoding profile for optimized streaming directly from the app. This feature requires support from your Subsonic server.
